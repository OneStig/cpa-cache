# Disjoint Set Union
#### :Cpa **dsu**

Disjoint Set Union (also known as union find) maintains an initially disconnected graph. You can then add edges between vertices and at any point query if two vertices are connected. This implementation uses path compression and stores the size of each component as a negative number at the root.
