# cpa-cache
cpa-cache (Competitive Programming Algorithms Cache) is my personal database of useful code for various contests, as well as my solutions to problems that I solve.

## Navigation
- `/cache` - Database of useful datastructures, algorithms, and code snippets
    - `pdfify.py` - Compiles all subdirectories into a pdf (used as a reference sheet in ICPC style competitions)
        - Requires [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org/installing.html)
    - Subdirectories will organize by topics, and each entry will contain both a code snippet and a corresponding markdown file with my explanations and thoughts.
- `/contests` - Directory with my solutions to problems from
    - `/Codeforces` - Problems from codeforces
    - `/CSES` - Problems from CSES
    - `/kattis` - Problems from kattis
